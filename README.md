Description: `modular rust http library`

This project will start after a research period.
I'm first going to make another http library in deno to get the basics and modularity.
After which I will proceed with making a rust library.

## Goals

This library will support HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSocket over any stream.
This allows TCP UDP Unix sockets stdin and even files. As long as the input is a stream, it wil work.
Besides that I will try to make this project as modular as possible.
